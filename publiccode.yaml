    shortDescription: >
          Successor of Open-ZaakBrug, an app for Dutch municipalities that supports the transition from "zaak- en documentatieservices" (zds) to "zaakgericht werken" (zgw).
          
    longDescription: >
          This project, ZaakBrug, is meant to be a successor of Open-ZaakBrug. 
          It leverages the Frank!Framework and its debugger Ladybug. The debugger shows for 
          each incoming request which steps are executed to process the message. 
          If there are errors, this information can be used for easy debugging. 
          ZaakBrug does not only connect zds systems with case register system OpenZaak, 
          but with any case register system that implements zgw.
